# PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

# DETAILED FEATURES OD AIRBNB CLONE PROJECT

The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.
 ### Features 
 Create Account : A user would be able create accou nt or sign up as a new user
 Property listing : User can list property in the app
 Delete : There is feature to delete listing 
 Payment : User can be able to make payment for the booking 
 Rating: user can rate a particular property after usage and also comment thier experience with the property
 Login : User can be able to login 
 Search : his feature would enable user to retrieved a particular property listing from the system


 # API SECURITY
Authentication: this would enable that there is no unauthorise access to user account, it would be design in such a way that when, the leave the  app, they have to identify themselves before gainning access

Authorization : not all user can access each location of the app, this would be use as wel to protect user data, for instance users that do not have a property listing should have full access over the property, like editing the listing info. this protect access and data 

  rate limiting : They have to be rate limiting for specific type of product so that similar  product would not have different rate 

  Payment hacve to work on this as well, bookimg should not be considered successful untill the complete fee is been paid
  
# CI/CD Pipeline
  CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It is a development practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code, helping teams deliver updates more frequently and reliably.

Why It Matters
Implementing CI/CD in this project ensures:

Code is automatically tested to catch bugs early.

Development and deployment are faster and more efficient.

Code quality and collaboration among team members improve significantly.

Common Tools
Some popular tools for setting up CI/CD include:

GitHub Actions â€“ Used to automate tasks like testing and deployment directly from GitHub.

Docker â€“ Helps package applications in containers for consistency across environments.

Jenkins, Travis CI, and CircleCI â€“ Widely used tools for managing automated build and deployment pipelines.
